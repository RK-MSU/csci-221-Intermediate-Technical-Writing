This doesn’t mean that technical documents should have no personality (or voice), but it does mean that the needs of your readers must come first. Placing the reader’s needs and interests first takes practice because many of us are taught to write from our own perspectives. For instance, assume you’ve been asked to create a set of instructions that explain how people in the community can bring house-hold hazardous waste (gasoline, paint) for recycling. 1.1.2 Information is Persuasive, Truthful, and Based on Reasearch Persuasion means trying to influence someone’s actions, opinions, or decisions. In the workplace, we rely on persuasion daily: to win coworker support, to attract clients and customers, or to request funding. But changing someone’s mind is never easy, and sometimes it is impossible. Your success will depend on who you are trying to persuade, what you are requesting, and how entrenched they are in their own views. 1.2 Three Primary Purposes of Technical Communication Most technical communication seeks to address one of three primary purposes: to anticipate and answer questions (inform), to enable people to perform a task (instruct), or to influence people’s thinking (persuade). Keep in mind that these purposes often overlap (as in the following sample documents). However, most documents have one primary purpose: to inform, to instruct, or to persuade. 1.2.1 Informational Purpose Informational documents anticipate and answer questions. Usually designed for a wide audience of readers who may know little about the topic, but the write has kept audience diversity in mind by anticipating and answering likely questions. 1.2.2 Instructional Purpose Instructional documents help people preform a task As we have all experienced, effective instructions can be a pleasure to work with because they help people do what they want to do. But poor instructions can create frustration, often causing people to return the product and to have second thoughts about purchasing that brand in the future. 1.2.3 Persuasive Purpose Persuasive documents encourage reader to take a desired action. Persuasive answer to a customer’s question: “Why should I invest in the system you are proposing for my plant?” As you read the letter, note how the writer focuses on reasons that are important to the reader. 1.3 Common Types of Technical Documents Memos. Organizations use memos as the primary means of internal written communication. Unlike a conversation, a memo leaves a record for future reference. An employee might write a memo to a manager requesting a pay raise; a team of students might write a memo to an instructor explaining their progress on a term project; or an office manager might write a memo to company employees to outline the new vacation policy. Most memos are sent out via email (either as an attachment or as a stand-alone email message). Email. Email is the main way people communicate in today’s workplace. Email is used widely to communicate with clients, customers, suppliers, and associates worldwide. Email messages are sometimes written more informally than paper memos or letters, but in the workplace, most writers recognize that email must maintain a similar level of professionalism to other formats. Letters. Letters, especially on company letterhead, offer a more formal way to communicate than email or memos. As a student, you might write a letter to request research data or to apply for a summer internship. At work, you might use a letter format to persuade a client to invest in a new technology or to explain the delay in a construction project. Instructions. Instructions explain the steps or course of action for completing a specific task such as how to use a fire extinguisher. Instructions come in various formats: online instructions may be accessible from the help menu of an app; brief instructions may be written on single-page reference cards; longer instructions may be part of a more comprehensive user manual. Procedures. Procedures are similar to instructions in that they explain how to perform a task step by step; however, procedures are different in that they usually deal with matters of company or organizational policy. Many companies maintain standard operating procedures (SOPs) for tasks such as how to test soil samples or how to access corporate databases. Manuals. Almost every technology product or service comes with a manual. Manuals may include instructions on how to assemble, set up, and use a product, but they also include background information, such as technical specifications or lists of materials. Most people have used manuals to perform tasks such as connecting the components of your sound system or setting up the voice mail on your office phone system. Most manuals are available in hard copy and for digital download. Brochures. To market goods or services, companies produce brochures. Brochures from professional organizations such as the American Medical Association may define various medical conditions, explain the causes, and describe available treatments. Many government agencies create brochures to help with issues such as how to obtain student loans or how to start a small business. Proposals. Proposals offer solutions to problems and make specific recommendations for how to implement those solutions. A proposal’s purpose is usually to persuade readers to improve conditions, accept a service or product, or otherwise support a plan of action. Proposals are often written in response to calls for proposals (CFPs) or requests for proposals (RFPs). For example, a nonprofit child-care facility may seek safer playground equipment, or a pharmaceutical company may wish to develop a new online education program for its employees. These organizations would issue RFPs, and each interested vendor would prepare a proposal that examines the problem, presents a solution, and defines the process and associated fees. Reports. Reports, both short and long, are generally based on the study of a specific problem or issue. Some reports are strictly informative (“Why Smartphone Batteries Can Explode”); other reports recommend solutions to urgent problems (“Recommended Security Measures for Airline Safety”); and still others have an overtly persuasive goal, advocating a particular course of action (“Why Voters Should Reject the Nuclear Waste Storage Facility Proposed for Our County”). 1.4 Technical Communication in Global, Collaborative, and Digital In the workplace, the documents we create have global implications, are typically written not by one individual but in teams, and are created using digital technologies and distributed electronically. 1.5 Technical Communication is Global Employees who work across different continents, countries, and cultures must pay special attention to various customs and values. Key to this practice is the idea of “face saving.” No one wants to be embarrassed in public, have his or her traditions or values criticized, or be treated with disrespect. (All these situations represent what is sometimes called a loss of “face.”) But people in different cultures have different views about what is embarrassing or insulting. For example, in some cultures a “tell it like it is” approach is considered rude, while in others body language such as leaning back in your chair and crossing your arms signals disrespect. 1.6 Technical Communication is Collaborative Teamwork is a frequent part of technical communication Complex technical documents (especially long reports, proposals, and manuals) are rarely created by one person working alone. In the workplace, such documents are typically produced by teams of writers, engineers, scientists, graphic artists, editors, reviewers, marketing personnel, lawyers, and other professionals. Teamwork is successful only when there is strong cooperation, a recognized team structure, and clear communication. The following Strategies explain how to work on a team project systematically. Strategies for Organizing a Team Project Appoint a group manager. The manager assigns tasks, enforces deadlines, conducts meetings, consults with supervisors, and “runs the show.” Define a clear and definite goal. Compose a purpose statement that spells out the project’s goal and the plan for achieving the goal. Be sure each team member understands the goal. Identify the type of document required. Is this a report, a proposal, a manual, or a brochure? Are visuals and supplements (abstract, appendices, and so on) needed? Will the document be made available online, in print, or both? Divide the tasks. Who will be responsible for which parts of the document or which phases of the project? Who is best at doing what (writing, editing, layout and graphics, oral presentation)? Which tasks will be done individually and which collectively? Spell out —in writing —clear expectations for each team member. Also keep in mind that the final version should display a consistent style throughout, as if written by one person only. Establish a timetable. A timetable will help the team visualize the whole project, each part of the project, and completion dates for each phase. Decide on a meeting schedule. How often, where, and for how long will the group meet? Establish a procedure for responding to each other’s work. Will reviewing and editing be done in writing, face to face, as a group, one on one, or online? Develop a file-naming system for various drafts. Be careful about saving documents. It’s too easy to save over a previous version and lose something important. Consider using a document sharing system such as Google drive or Dropbox. Establish procedures for dealing with interpersonal problems. How will disputes be discussed and resolved (by vote, by the manager, or by other means)? How will irrelevant discussion be curtailed? Select a group decision-making style. Will decisions be made by the group manager alone, by group input, or by majority vote? Decide how to evaluate each member’s contribution. Will the manager assess each member’s performance and in turn be evaluated by each member? Will members evaluate each other? What are the criteria? Prepare a project planning form. Figure 1.6 shows a sample form you can adapt for your team. Submit regular progress reports. These reports (see page 265) track activities, problems, and rate of progress. 1.6.1 Running Successful Meetings Face-to-face meetings are either informational or decision based Usually scheduled for one of two purposed: - to convey or exchange information - make decisions Informational meetings tend to run smoothly because there is less cause for disagreement. But decision-based meetings often fail to reach clear resolution because the meeting leader fails to take charge. Running a meeting doesn’t mean imposing one’s views or stifling opposing views, but it does mean keeping the discussion moving and centered on the issue. 1.6.2 Identifying and Managing Group Conflicts Even when all team members have good working relationships and positive attitudes, conflicts still can arise, usually because of the following factors: Interpersonal styles. People who work on teams often clash because of differences in a range of areas, including personality, working style, cultural norms, or ability to take criticism. Some might disagree about exactly what or how much the group should accomplish, who should do what, or who should have the final say. Some might feel intimidated or hesitant to speak out. Certain people may be comfortable with a “just the facts” approach, while others on the team may interpret this style for rudeness. Digital communication. When we communicate via text or email, ideas can be easily misunderstood. The lack of vocal inflection and facial features (such as a smile or frown) can turn what you thought was a humorous comment into a serious insult. Also, because we write more quickly in digital settings, we may not proofread carefully and thus might leave out important information, causing the team to become confused and concerned. Cultural differences. According to one expert, some cultures value intuition and ambiguity more than hard evidence or data, or they prioritize politeness and personal relationships more than business relationships. Cultures also differ in their perceptions of time. Some are “all business” and like to get directly to the point; others take as long as they feel is needed to weigh the issues and come to carefully considered conclusions (Victor, 233). Finally, cultures differ in their accepted methods of communication, varying in their willingness to express disagreement, question or be questioned, leave things unstated, or use nonverbal language (Victor, 206). 1.6.3 Reviewing and Editing the Work of Others Reviewing means evaluating how well a document connects with its audience and meets its purpose. Reviewers typically examine a document to make sure it includes these features: accurate, appropriate, useful, and legal content material organized for the reader’s understanding clear, easy-to-read, and engaging style effective visuals and page design Editing means polishing a document by making it more precise and readable at the sentence and word level.Editing may happen simultaneously with reviewing, but usually it comes after a document has been reviewed and revised—when the more global considerations of content, organization, style, and design have already been resolved and the editor can focus on more particular details. Editors typically suggest improvements such as these: rephrasing or reorganizing sentences clarifying a topic sentence choosing a better word or phrase correcting spelling, usage, punctuation, and so on Strategies for Peer Review and Editing Read the entire piece at least twice before you comment. Develop a clear sense of the document’s purpose and audience. Try to visualize the document as a whole before you evaluate specific parts. Focus first on the big picture. Begin with the document’s content and organization. Is the document appropriate for its audience and purpose? Is the supporting material relevant and convincing? Is the discussion easy to follow? Does each paragraph do its job? Do all the visuals serve a distinct and appropriate purpose? Is the design appropriate for this document? Be honest but diplomatic. Say what you think, but don’t merely offer negative comments. Begin with something positive before moving to suggested improvements. Maintain a supportive tone. Explain why something doesn’t work. Instead of “this paragraph is confusing,” say “because this paragraph lacks a clear topic sentence, | had trouble discovering the main idea.” Instead of “I don’t like this visual,” say “this visual doesn’t work, not only because it is a little blurry, but also because it doesn’t add to the discussion.” Make specific recommendations for improvements. Write out suggestions in enough detail for the writer to know what to do. Don’t just say “I think you should add a chart here.” Instead offer “I think you should add a new chart here to show all the numerical information you’ve provided in an easy-to-understand visual way.” Don’t expect everyone to agree with your suggestions. Even professional editors can disagree. Offer your best advice but don’t dictate— others may have better suggestions. If different readers offer conflicting opinions of what needs to be revised, seek your team leader’s opinion or take it to a vote. Understand the acceptable limits of editing. Don’t simply rewrite an entire document in your own words. Although changes can range from making a few suggestions and additions to closely editing every paragraph, always preserve the author’s original vision and style. Focus next on the particulars. Once the document has been reviewed and revised for content, organization, style, and design, refine the sentences and word choice—and proofread several times. 1.7 Technical Communication is Digital In today’s workplace, teams are distributed across different locations, working hours, time zones, and countries. Even within the same local team, some people may work from home while others work mainly from the office. The following technologies are used regularly in technical communication: Teleconferencing. The oldest form of virtual collaboration—still very much in use—occurs when multiple callers hold a conference via the telephone. Email. The most popular app for workplace communication, email is used for sending attachments and keeping track of ideas and discussions among team members and individuals. Instant messaging (IM). IM is a fast and easy way to hold a real-time conversation among multiple people, as long as they are all logged in. Project management software. Most large organizations use dedicated software, such as Microsoft Project, to manage complex team projects. Editing software. Editing tools allow multiple users to see each other’s edits (which are tagged by the user’s initials) and to accept or reject those changes. An example is Microsoft Word’s “track changes” feature. Digital whiteboards. These tools provide a large screen that allows participants to write, sketch, and erase from their own computers in real time. Web conferencing. A password-protected Web site provides the medium for this more contemporary version of teleconferencing. Blogs. Blogs allow people to create postings or add comments to previous postings as a way for teams to share and refine ideas. Intranets. Intranets are sites set up for internal company use only. Readers can access files, documents, and other content. Wikis. Wikis can be set up to allow access only to those directly involved in the project. When a team member edits a document, a new version is created and old versions saved. Checklist for Effective Technical Communication Does my document focus on the reader, not the writer? Is the document efficient and accessible? Is the document clear and easy to understand? Does the document give readers what they need? Have | used the appropriate media to convey my message? Have | created the document to address a global audience as needed? Am | able to work as part of a team? Is the document sufficiently persuasive to get the response | want? Is the document based on careful research? Does the document achieve its primary purpose (i.e., inform, instruct, persuade)—or a combination of purposes? Global Considerations Do | understand the communication customs of the international audience for my document? Is my writing clear and direct so that it is easy to translate? Have | avoided idioms, humor, and slang? Have | avoided stereotyping different cultures and groups of people? Is the communication about this project respectful to everyone? Collaborative Considerations Has our team appointed a team manager? Does the team agree on the type of document required? Do we have a plan for how to divide the tasks? Have we established a timetable and decided on a meeting schedule? Do we have an agenda for our first meeting? Are we using the project planning form (page 16) to help us get organized? Digital Considerations Have we decided which apps we will use for our collaboration (Google Drive; Microsoft OneDrive; other)? Do we know which digital features our document requires (text only; text plus images; video) and how it will be distributed (online as a downloadable PDF; as a Word file stored on the company Intranet)?

Whatever their specific goals and concerns in using a particular document, readers must be able to do at least three things: Locate the information they need easily. Understand the information immediately. Use the information safely and successfully. To assess the usability of a manual that comes with your new gas grill, for instance, you would ask: “How well do these instructions enable me to assemble, operate, and main- tain the grill safely and effectively?” To prepare a usable document, follow these six steps: Analyze the document’s audience. Determine the document’s purpose. Create a task analysis for the document. Consider the setting, potential problems, length, format, timing, and budget. Develop an information plan for the document. Write, test, and revise the document. 2.1 Analyze the Document’s Audience You cannot create an effective document until you first explore all you can about who will use your document. In other words, understand your audience. Ask these questions: Who is the main audience for this document? Who else is likely to read it? What is your relationship with the audience? Are there multiple types of relationships involved? How familiar might the audience be with technical details? What culture or cultures does your audience represent? What media format (printed manual; PDF available online; interactive Web page) is best for this audience? 2.1.1 Primary and Secondary Audiences When writing technical documents, keep two audiences in mind. Most documents are geared to an immediate audience. This is your primary audience. But most documents also have a secondary audience- those outside the immediate circle of people who will be needing information directly. 2.1.2 Relationship with Audience Determining the answer to this question will help you determine the formality of your document. Do you know the readers personally? Are they likely to welcome or reject your information? Are they a combination of people at various levels? 2.1.3 Audience’s Technical Background Any message can be conveyed in numerous ways, depending on how it is written and designed for different audiences. The broader the audience, the more you must consider the various levels of expertise and language usage. 2.1.4 Audience’s Cultural Background Information needs and preferences often are culturally determined. Although it is not possible to generalize about an entire group of people from a particular culture or country, international communication experts have noted some characteristics can be helpful. German audiences, for example, often value thoroughness and complexity with detail included and explained in a businesslike tone. Japanese audiences generally prefer multiple perspectives on the material, plenty of graphics, and a friendly, encouraging tone (Hein 125-26). Western business culture generally values plain talk that gets right to the point, but Eastern cultures may consider this rude, preferring indirect, more ambiguous messages that leave interpretation up to the reader. The more you can learn about your specific readers for your specific document or information, the more you can consider how cultural differences might create misunderstanding in your situation and seek an approach that bridges these differences. strategies for Analyzing Your Audience Picture your readers and exactly what they need and expect. Whether your audience is the company president or the person next to you in class, that person has specific concerns and information needs. Your readers may need to complete a task, solve a problem, make a decision, evaluate your performance, or take a stand on an issue. Identify the primary and secondary audiences, your relationship to them, and their technical and cultural background. Remember that if your document will be widely available via the Internet, you may need to add an explicit audience statement (“this material is written for the following audiences…”) and/or provide links that direct people of different technical backgrounds to information suited for their background and needs. When you don’t know exactly who will be reading your document, picture the “general reader.” General readers are impatient with abstract theories yet expect enough background to help them grasp your message. They are bored or confused by excessive detail and frustrated by raw facts left unexplained or not interpreted. Instead of trying to show readers how smart you are, make them feel smart. Whoever they are, readers need enough material to understand your position and to react appropriately. Anticipate readers’ questions. Based on their needs and concerns, readers have questions: What is it? What does it mean? What happened? Who was involved? When, where, and why did it happen? What might happen? How do | do it? How did you do it? Why is X better than Y? Can you give examples? Says who? So what? Give readers what they need to know. Recognize that audiences are not merely passive recipients of information. Technical communicators and their audiences should overlap and interact. Therefore, as you analyze and learn about your audience, remember that the communication process works both ways, especially in online settings where readers are invited to leave feedback and ask questions. Use this information to refine and update your document based on what you learn from these readers. 2.2 Determine the Document’s Purpose To create an effective technical document you need to understand how readers will use it. In other words, determine your purpose. Ask these questions: What is the main purpose of the document? What other purpose or purposes does the document serve? What will readers do with this information? 2.2.1 Primary and Secondary Purposes All forms of technical communication are intended to fulfill a specific primary purpose. As discussed in Chapter 1, the primary purpose (to inform, to instruct, or to persuade) will affect the document’s overall shape and substance. Many documents have a primary purpose and one or more secondary purposes. For example, the primary purpose in most instruction manuals is to instruct; that is, to teach an audience how to assemble or use the product. But for ethical and legal reasons, companies also want people to use the product safely. A manual for a power tool or a lawnmower, for instance, typically begins with a page that spells out safety hazards before instructing readers how to assemble and use the mechanism. In planning a document, work from a clear statement of purpose that takes into account both the primary and secondary purposes. For example, “The purpose of my document is to inform my readers of the new absentee policy and to instruct them on how to follow the procedures properly,” or “The purpose of my document is to inform my readers about the new antivirus software as well as to instruct them on how to install the software and to persuade them of the importance of running weekly virus scans.” 2.2.2 Intended Use of the Document In addition to determining purposes of a document from your own perspective, also consider how and why it will be used by others. Answer a variety of questions: Do my readers simply want to learn facts or understand concepts? Will they use my information in making some decision? Will people act immediately on the information? Do they need step-by-step instructions? In my audience’s view, what is most important about this document? How and where will they use the document (outdoors while trying to assemble a new gas grill or tool shed? On their computer or phone as a PDF document while trying to fix a flat tire or install new software?) In addition to asking yourself these questions, try asking members of your audience directly, so you can verify what they want to know and where and how they will use the document. 2.3 Know How to Be Persuasive In the workplace, we rely on persuasion daily: to win coworker support, to attract clients and customers, to request funding. An email, a memo, a product description, or a set of instructions can be an implicitly persuasive document. Even the most complex report, which at first glance may appear to be “all facts,” can be persuasive because the writer probably shaped the report to favor a particular interpretation of the data. Changing someone’s mind is never easy—in fact, sometimes it is impossible. Your success will depend on what you are requesting, who you are trying to persuade, and how entrenched those people are in their own views. 2.3.1 Using Claims as a Basis for Persuasion Explicit persuasion is required whenever you tackle an issue about which people disagree. Assume, for example, that you are Manager of Employee Relations at Softbyte, a software developer whose recent sales have plunged. To avoid layoffs, the company is trying to persuade employees to accept a temporary cut in salary. As you plan your various memos and presentations on this volatile issue, you must first identify your major claim or claims (a claim is a statement of the point you are trying to prove). For example, in the Softbyte case, you might first want employees to recognize and acknowledge facts about which they may have been unaware or have ignored: Because of the global recession, our software sales in two recent quarters have fallen nearly 30 percent, and earnings should remain flat all year. Even when a fact is obvious, people often disagree about what it means or what should be done about it. And so you might want to influence their interpretation of the facts: Reduced earnings mean temporary layoffs for roughly 25 percent of our staff. But we could avoid layoffs entirely if each of us at Softbyte would accept a 10 percent salary cut until the market improves. And eventually you might want to ask for direct action: Our labor contract stipulates that such an across-the-board salary cut would require a two-thirds majority vote. Once you’ve had time to examine the facts, we hope you’ll vote “yes” on next Tuesday’s ballot. 2.3.2 Connecting with Your Audience Determine how best to connect with your audience. Persuasive people know when to simply declare what they want (get the reader to comply with what you say), when to reach out and create a relationship (get the reader to identify with what you say), when to appeal to reason and common sense (get the reader to internalize what you say), and when to employ some combination of these approaches. Three approaches for connecting with an audience 2.4 Create a Task Analysis for the Document Most technical documents entail a series of tasks to be completed, tasks most evident in a set of instructions: If people want to change an oil filter, assemble a new gas grill, or install a new project management app, they must follow a step-by-step procedure. Less obvious is that other documents, such as reports, memos, and brochures. 2.5 Consider Other Related Usability Factors Once you’ve answered questions about audience (Who?), purpose (Why?), and tasks (How?), it’s time to consider smaller but no less important factors that influence the usability of your document: setting (Where?), potential problems (What are the hazards?), length (How much information?), format (Print? PDF? Interactive Web page or app?), timing (When?), and budget (How much money?). 2.5.1 Setting Will distractions or interruptions make it hard for people to pay attention? Will readers always have the document in front of them? Will they be scanning the document, studying it, or memorizing it? Will they read page by page or consult the document randomly? 2.5.2 Potential Problems How might the document be misinterpreted or misunderstood? Are there potential “trouble spots” (material too complex for this audience, hard to follow, or packed with information)? Are any important points missing? Anticipating problems is important in creating any technical document but especially in a set of instructions; therefore, when preparing instructions plan on background research. In planning the gas grill instruction manual, for example, learn all you can about the typical audience for this information (age, education, and so on). If possible, observe first-time operators using the instructions for a previous model and then ask for their feedback. Also, find out how most injuries occur, check company records for customer complaints, get feedback from dealers, and ask your legal department about prior injury claims by customers. 2.5.3 Length How much information is enough? This depends on what you can learn about your audience’s needs. Were you asked to “keep it short” or to “be comprehensive”? Are people more interested in conclusions and recommendations, or do they want everything spelled out? If you can observe people using draft versions of your document, you will quickly be able to see when a section is too long versus when you have not included enough information. 2.5.4 Format Does your audience expect a letter, a memo, a short report, or a long, formal report with supplements (title page, table of contents, appendices, and so on—see pages 294-306)? Can visuals and page layout (charts, graphs, drawings, headings, lists) make the material more accessible? Should the document be made available only in PDF format, online, where readers can make print copies if they wish? Or is there a legal or other reason why you need to include a print copy? 2.5.5 Timing Does your document have a deadline? Workplace documents almost always do. Is there a best time to submit it? Do you need to break down the deadline into a schedule of milestones? Will any of your information become outdated if you wait too long to complete the document? 2.5.6 Budget Does your document have a budget? If so, how much? Where can you save money? How much time can your company afford to allot you for creating the document? How much money can you spend obtaining permission to use materials from other sources? How much can you spend on printing, binding, and distributing your document? How much of the budget is dedicated to creating digital documents or a Web site or app to go along with (or take the place of) the document? 2.6 Write, Test, Revise, and Proofread the Document Ask respondents to: Content. Are there any inaccuracies? Is the level of technicality appropriate to this audience? Are claims, conclusions, or recommendations supported by evidence? Are all key terms defined? Is the material free of gaps, foggy areas, or needless details? Organization. Is the structure of the document visible at a glance? Is anything out of order or hard to find or follow? Is the material “chunked” into easily digestible parts? Is the material organized in a logical sequence? Style. Is anything hard to understand, imprecise, too complex, or too wordy? Are sentences put together with enough variety? Is the tone appropriate for the situation? Are words chosen for exactness, not for camouflage? Layout and visuals. Are there adequate aids to navigation (heads, numbered lists, bullets, type styles)? Are there any excessively long paragraphs, lists, or steps? Are any visuals overly complex or misleading? Could anything be clarified by a visual? Is anything cramped and hard to read? Ethical, legal, and cultural considerations. Is there any distortion or misrepresentation of facts? Are there any potential legal or safety concerns? Proofreading: Sentence errors, such as fragments, comma splices, or run-ons Punctuation errors, such as missing apostrophes or excessive commas Usage errors, such as “it’s” for “its”; “lay” for “lie”; or “their” for “there” Mechanical errors, such as misspelled words, inaccurate dates, or incorrect abbreviations Formatting errors, such as missing page numbers, inconsistent spacing, or incorrect form of documenting sources Typographical errors (typos), such as repeated or missing words or letters, missing word endings (say, -s or -ed or -ing), or an omitted quotation mark "],

Your style is a blend of these elements: the way in which you construct each sentence the length of your sentences the way in which you connect sentences the words and phrases you choose the tone you convey Inefficient style makes readers work harder than they should. Style can be inefficient for many reasons but especially when it does the following: makes the writing impossible to interpret takes too long to make the point reads like a story from primary school sounds stuffy and impersonal Regardless of the cause, inefficient style results in writing that is less informative and less persuasive than it should be. Also, inefficient style can be unethical when it confuses or misleads the audience, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, take the time to write with a readable style, using the strategies described in the following sections: writing clearly, writing concisely, writing fluently, and writing personably. 5.2 Writing Clearly Clear writing enables people to read each sentence only once to fully grasp its meaning. Strategies for writing clearly include avoiding ambiguous pronoun references, avoiding ambiguous modifiers, using active voice whenever possible, using passive voice selectively, avoiding nominalizations, unstacking nouns, and avoiding unnecessary jargon. Avoiding Ambiguous Pronoun References Pronouns (he, she, it, their, and so on) must clearly refer to the nouns they replace; otherwise, the sentence will be ambiguous and readers will puzzle over your intended meaning. For example, consider the following sentence, in which the reader is unable to discern whether Jack or his assistant is competitive: Jack resents his assistant because he is competitive. Depending on whether the referent for “he” is Jack or his assistant, the sentence can be clarified: Because his assistant is competitive, Jack resents him. or Because Jack is competitive, he resents his assistant. 5.2.1 Avoiding Ambiguous Modifiers A modifier is a word (usually an adjective or adverb) or a group of words (usually a phrase or clause) that provides information about other words or groups of words. If a modifier is too far from the words it modifies, the message can be ambiguous. For instance, in the following sentence, the reader cannot discern whether “only” modifies “press” or “emergency”: Only press the red button in an emergency. If, however, the writer repositions the modifier, the sentence becomes clear: Press only the red button in an emergency. or Press the red button in an emergency only. 5.2.2 Using Active Voice Whenever Possible In general, readers understand the meaning more quickly and clearly when the writer uses active voice (“I did it”) rather than the passive voice (“It was done by me”). In active voice sentences, a clear agent performs a clear action on a recipient, as in the following example: Felix lost your report. Passive voice, by contrast, reverses this pattern, placing the recipient of the action (i.e., report, in the previous example) in the subject slot, as in the following sentence: Your report was lost by Felix. Note that passive voice adds a form of the verb “be” (“was”) next to the actual verb. Some writers mistakenly rely on passive voice because they think it sounds more objective and important. But passive voice makes sentences wordier and harder to understand. In addition, passive voice sometimes obscures the subject of the sentence, as in the following example: Your report was lost. Passive voice is unethical if it obscures the person or other agent who performed the action when the person or agent responsible should be identified. In the above example, “Your report was lost” leaves out the responsible party. (Who lost the report?) For these reasons, favor the active voice in most writing situations. 5.2.3 Using Passive Voice Selectively There are times when the passive voice is appropriate: for instance, when the subject is not known or when the object is more important than the subject. For example, if a group of scientists performed an experiment and wanted to explain the results, they might write the following: The data were analyzed, and the findings were discussed. Even here, active voice (“We analyzed the data…”) would be preferable. But if it is clear who analyzed the data or truly not important who did the work, passive voice might be acceptable. Passive voice can also ease the blow a direct sentence might deliver: &gt; You have not paid your bill. To be indirect and less offensive, the writer may choose passive voice instead: Your bill has not been paid. Consider this technique when you want to avoid a blunt or hostile tone. But in general, to convey clear, readable technical information, use active voice. 5.2.4 Avoiding Nominalizations A nominalization is a noun that would be easier to understand as a verb. Verbs are generally easier to read because they signal action that can be visualized. You can usually spot a nominalization in two ways. First, look for words with -tion endings. Second, look for sentences in which the “[noun] of [noun]” formula appears. Following is an example of each type of nominalization: My recommendation is for a larger budget. The managing of this project is up to me. To fix the -tion problem, strike the ending to find the root verb (“recommend”) and rewrite the sentence in a more direct form. To fix the “[noun] of [noun]” problem, identify the root verb form (“manage”) and create a more accessible sentence. Following are improved versions of the above sentences: recommend a larger budget. manage this project. 5.2.5 Unstack Modifying Nouns Too many nouns in a row can create confusion for readers. One noun can modify another (as in “software development”). But when two or more nouns modify a noun, the string of words becomes “stacked”—in other words, hard to read and ambiguous. For example: Be sure to leave enough time for today’s training session participant evaluation. In the previous sentence, the reader is left unsure whether evaluation is of the session or of the participants. With no articles, prepositions, or verbs to unstack the nouns, readers cannot sort out the relationships among the nouns. To fix the problem, separate the stacked nouns by changing some nouns into verb forms where appropriate, as in the following example: Be sure to leave enough time for participants to evaluate today’s training session. or Be sure to leave enough time to evaluate the participants in today’s training session. 5.2.6 Avoiding Unnecessary Jargon Every profession has its own shorthand and accepted phrases and terms. Among specialists, these terms are an economical way to communicate. For example, “stat” (from the Latin statim, “immediately”) is medical jargon for “drop everything and deal with this emergency.” Jargon can be useful in communications among specialists. However, to avoid confusion, use jargon only when you know your audience will understand it and not simply to sound important or pretentious. Consider the following sentence: We will bilaterally optimize our efforts on this project. Clearly, that writer meant to sound important, but to most readers, the sentence is simultaneously meaningless and pretentious. Following is a clear and simple version: We will cooperate on this project. 5.3 Writing Concisely Concise writing provides readers with all of the information they need but without any needless filler. Strategies for writing concisely include avoiding wordiness and eliminating redundancy and repetition. 5.3.1 Avoiding Wordiness Wordiness is often unavoidable in a first draft, when a writer is simply trying to get thoughts down on the page. For your readers, however, wordiness is distracting and detracts from a writer’s credibility. When you edit your document, go through each sentence and work to eliminate excess words. Wordiness has multiple causes: First, some writers habitually use needless phrases that can be reduced to one word: at a rapid rate = rapidly due to the fact that = because aware of the fact that = know in close proximity to = near the majority of = most Second, many writers tend to start sentences with “there is,” “there are,” and “it is,” which can often be eliminated: There is a danger of explosion in Number 2 mineshaft. = Number 2 mineshaft is in danger of exploding. It is necessary to complete both sides of the form. = Please complete both sides of the form. Third, writers often gravitate to weak verbs, such as all forms of the verb “to be” (“am,” “are,” “is,” etc.), “give,” “make,” “come,” and “take.” These verbs need to be combined with other words to express fuller meaning, but they can easily be replaced with stronger verbs that can stand on their own: has the ability to = can make an assumption = assume come to the conclusion that = conclude give a summary of = summarize take action = act Fourth, writers often overuse prepositional phrases, which can easily be reduced to one or two words: with the exception of = except for in the near future = soon at the present time = now in the course of = during in the process of = during (or in) Finally, many writers pad their writing by using clutter words (such as “very,” “quite,” “somewhat,” “really,” “actually”), needless qualifiers (“I think,” “in my opinion,” “it seems”), and unnecessary prefaces (“As far as lam concerned,” “the purpose of this is”) that add no meaning to a sentence. Of course, if you are expressing a tentative position on a complex issue, do use a qualifier (“I think,” “it seems”) as appropriate. 5.3.2 Eliminating Redundancy and Repetition A redundant expression says the same thing twice, in different words, whereas a repetition says the same thing twice or more in the same words. Following are examples of each, which can be fixed simply through cutting out the bracketed words. 5.4 Writing Fluently When you write fluently, you will hold your readers’ interest and attention by making clear connections between ideas and by reducing monotony. Strategies for writing fluently include combining related ideas, varying sentence construction and length, and using parallel structure. 5.4.1 Combining Related Ideas Readers who are forced to trudge through a series of short, choppy sentences will not only lose interest but will also fail to see how ideas are meant to be related or which ideas should receive emphasis. For example, the following string of five short sentences makes for dull reading. In addition, it forces readers to invent transitions between ideas and decide which points are most important: Running can be healthful. You need the right equipment. Well-fitting shoes are important. You take the chance of injuring your legs. Your knees are especially prone to injury. In contrast, the following two-sentence revision reads more smoothly and places a stronger emphasis on the importance of having the right jogging shoes: Running can be healthful if you have the right equipment. Shoes that fit well are particularly important because they prevent injury to your legs, especially your knees. 5.4.2 Varying Sentence Construction and Length While you should combine short, choppy sentences into longer, more fluid versions, you don’t want to create a string of unvaried longer sentences. Readers will find these just as monotonous, and they will also have a hard time determining which points are meant to receive emphasis. For example, the following two longer sentences are unvaried and dull, and at the same time the reader is forced to decide which of the five points made is the most important: Two drawbacks of diesel engines are that they are difficult to start in cold weather and cause sulfur dioxide pollution. In addition, they give off noise, emit an unpleasant odor, and cause vibrations. In contrast, the following two-sentence revision reads less monotonously and incorporates one short sentence to place special emphasis on sulfur dioxide pollution: Diesel engines have a number of drawbacks, including cold weather starting difficulties, noisiness, odor, and vibrations. More seriously, they also cause sulfur dioxide pollution. 5.4.3 Using Parallel Structure Parallel structure is a fancy way of saying that similar items should be expressed in similar grammatical form. Without parallelism, readers will lose attention, being mentally forced to “fix” the grammatical fluency of your sentence. For example, the structure of the following sentence is not parallel: She likes many outdoor activities, including running, kayaking, and to design new hiking trails. This sentence is essentially a list of items. The first two items, “running” and “kayaking,” are expressed as gerunds (verbs converted into nouns by using -ing endings). The third item, “to design,” is not a gerund but a verb followed by an object. To make this sentence parallel and increase its fluency you would revise as follows: She likes many outdoor activities, including running, kayaking, and designing new hiking trails. 5.5 Writing Personably When you write in a personable manner, you connect directly with your readers and avoid inadvertently offending them. Strategies for writing personably include adjusting your tone and avoiding sexist and biased language. 5.5.1 Adjusting Your Tone Your tone is your personal stamp—the personality that takes shape between the lines. The tone you create depends on 1) the distance you impose between yourself and the reader, and 2) the attitude you show toward the subject. To increase the likelihood of bringing readers over to your side, see the Strategies that follow. 5.5.2 Strategies for Deciding about Tone {- Determine if you want a formal, semiformal, or informal tone. You may prefer a formal tone when writing to superiors, professionals, or academics (depending on what you think they expect), a semiformal tone for colleagues and subordinates (depending on how close you feel to your readers), or a slightly informal tone when you want your writing to be conversational. Remain consistent. Once you’ve determined the appropriate overall tone of the document, stay with it throughout. Address readers directly. Prefer the personal pronouns “you” and “your” to connect with readers. Use “I” and “we” when appropriate. Instead of disappearing behind your writing, use “I” and “we” to connect with your readers. Prefer the active voice. Show confidence and directness by using active rather than passive voice. Emphasize the positive. Avoid a negative tone when conveying unpleasant information. Always avoid an overly informal tone. Achieving a conversational tone does not mean relying on substandard usage (“He ain’t got none”), profanity (“This idea sucks”), and colloquialisms (“OK,” “a lot,” “snooze”). Pay special attention to tone when using email (see Chapter 18 for more on email tone and style). 5.5.3 Avoiding Biased Language Language that is offensive or makes unwarranted assumptions is inappropriate for workplace communication and may harm the reputation of a company or organization. For example, letters addressed to “Dear Sir” may leave an unfavorable impression of the company on all readers but especially on women. Unnecessary mention of gender, marital status, physical appearances, and ethnicity may also alienate readers. Strategies for Unbiased Usage Use neutral expressions. Use “chair” or “chairperson” rather than “chairman” and “postal worker” rather than “postman.” Don’t mention gender if it is not relevant. Don’t use “the female police officer” unless you are talking about police officers in the context of gender. Avoid sexist pronouns. You can avoid using a sexist pronoun by revising the sentence (“A writer who revises will succeed” rather than “A writer will succeed if he revises”), by using a plural form (“Writers will succeed if they revise”), or by occasionally using paired pronouns (“A writer will succeed if he or she revises”). Drop condescending diminutive endings. Avoid words such as “poetess” and “majorette” and simply use “poet” and “major” instead. Use “Ms.” Unless you know that a person prefers a traditional title, avoid “Mrs.” and “Miss.” Males are not identified by marital status, nor should females have to be. "],

["definitions.html", "Chapter 7 Definitions 7.1 Audience and Purpose of Definitions 7.2 Legal, Safety, and Societal Implications of Definitions 7.3 Types of Definitions 7.4 Methods for Expanding Definitions 7.5 Placement of Definitions 7.6 Strategies for Definitions", " Chapter 7 Definitions Definitions explain specialized terms or concepts and may be unfamiliar to people who don’t have expertise in a particular field. In many cases, a term may have more than one meaning or different meanings in different fields. 7.1 Audience and Purpose of Definitions Definitions make a documents usable for an audience by answering one of two questions: “What, exactly, does this definition entail?” How the audience are affected by the item defined. “What, exactly, is the process, item, concept, or technique?” What makes an item, concept, or process unique. Unless you are certain your audience will grasp the exact meaning, always define a term the first time you use it. 7.2 Legal, Safety, and Societal Implications of Definitions Legal implications of definitions can be seen in documents such as contracts, which are detailed, legally binding definitions of the specific terms of an agreement. Safety implications. From areas such as food safety 7.3 Types of Definitions There are three distinct categories: parenthetical, sentence, and expanded definitions. 7.3.1 Parenthetical Definitions Often, you can clarify the meaning of a word by using a more familiar synonym or a clarifying phrase in parentheses immediately after the word. The leaching field (sieve-like drainage area) requires a crushed stone. The trees on the site are mostly deciduous (shedding foliage at season’s end) On a Web page of online help system, parenthetical definitions can be linked to the main word or phrase rather than in parentheses after the word. In a print document, word or phrases are often defined in a separate list of defined items, known as a glossary. 7.3.2 Sentence Definitions A slightly longer way to define a phrase is to use the “term-class-features” method to form a sentence definition. Begin by stating the term Indicate the broader class to which items belong Followed by the features the distinguish it from other items in the general grouping Use a sentence definition when a concept requires further elaboration than a parenthetical definition could offer. Sentence Definitions Examples Sentence definitions are especially useful if you plan to use a term frequently and need to establish a working definition that you will not need to repeat throughout the document: Throughout this report, the term disadvantaged student will refer to all students who lack adequate funds to pay for on-campus housing, food services, and medical care, but who are able to pay for their coursework and books through scholarships and part-time work. 7.3.3 Expanded Definitions A document that requires more detail or a highly complex term would call for an expanded definition. An expanded definition may be a short paragraph or may extend to several pages. 7.4 Methods for Expanding Definitions The methods you decide to use will depend on the questions you expect the audience will want to be answered: Questions to Determine the best Expansion Approach 7.4.1 Etymology Sometimes, a word’s origin (its development and changing meanings), can help clarify its meaning. For example, biometrics (the statistical analysis of biological data) is a word derived from the Greek bio, meaning life, and metron, meaning measure. 7.4.2 History In some cases, the history of a term, concept, or procedure can be useful in expanding a definition. You might expand the definition of a laser by describing how the laser was invented: The early researchers in fiber optic communications were hampered by two principal difficulties — the lack of a sufficiently intense source of light and the absence of a medium which could transmit this light free from interference and with a minimum signal loss. Lasers emit a narrow beam of intense light, so their invention in 1960 solved the first problem. The development of a means to convey this signal was longer in coming, but scientists succeeded in developing the first communications-grade optical fiber of almost pure silica glass in 1970 (Stanton 28). 7.4.3 Negation Some definitions can be clarified by explaining what the term does not mean. For example, the following definition of a laser eliminates any misconceptions an audience might already have about lasers: A laser is an electronic device that emits a highly concentrated beam of light. It is used for many beneficial purposes (including corrective eye and other surgeries), not—as science fiction might tell you—as a transport medium to other dimensions. 7.4.4 Operating Principle The following example not only defines what a laser is but also shows the operating principle behind it: Basically, a laser [uses electrical energy to produce] coherent light: light in which all the waves are in phase with each other, making the light hotter and more intense (Gartaganis 23). 7.4.5 Analysis of Parts Be sure to list all of the parts to create a complete picture, and, if necessary, define the individual parts as well, as in the following expanded definition of a laser: Analysis of Parts Example 7.4.6 Visuals Make sure any visual you use is labeled clearly. Always introduce and explain your visual and place the visual near your discussion. If the visual is borrowed, credit the source. The following visual accompanies the previous analysis of parts: Visuals Example 7.4.7 Comparison and Contrast By comparing (showing similarities) or by contrasting (showing differences) between new information and information your audience already understands, you help build a bridge between what people already know and what they don’t. 7.5 Placement of Definitions Each time readers encounter an unfamiliar term or concept, that item should be defined in the same area on the page or screen. In a printed text, you can place a brief definitions in parentheses or in the document’s margin, aligned with the terms being defined. For longer reports, you can create a glossary. Glossaries are placed at the beginning or the end of a document, depending on organizational preferences. Sentence definitions should be part of the running text. Place an expanded definition either near the beginning of a long document or in an appendix. On a Web site, hyperlinks are a great way to make expanded definitions accessible because readers can click on an item, read about it, and then return to the original page. 7.6 Strategies for Definitions Decide on the level of detail you need. Definitions vary greatly in length and detail, from a few words in parentheses to a multipage document. How much does this audience need in order to follow your explanation or grasp your point? Classify the item precisely. The narrower your class, the clearer your meaning. Stress is classified as an applied force; to say that stress “is what…” or “takes place when…” fails to denote a specific classification. Diabetes is precisely classified as a metabolic disease, not as a medical term. Differentiate the item accurately. If the distinguishing features are too broad, they will apply to more than this one item. A definition of brief as a “legal document used in court” fails to differentiate briefs from all other legal documents (wills, affidavits, and the like). Avoid circular definitions. Do not repeat, as part of the distinguishing feature, the word you are defining. “Stress is an applied force that places stress on a body” is a circular definition. Expand your definition selectively. Begin with a sentence definition and select the best expansion strategy or combination of expansion strategies for your audience and purpose. Use visuals to clarify your meaning. No matter how clearly you explain, as the saying goes, a picture can be worth a thousand words—even more so when used with readable, accurate writing. Know “how much is enough.” Don’t insult people’s intelligence by giving needless details or spelling out the obvious. Consider the legal implications of your definition. What does an unsatisfactory job performance mean in an evaluation of a company employee: that the employee could be fired, required to attend a training program, or given one or more chances to improve (Performance Appraisal 3-4)? Failure to spell out your meaning invites a lawsuit. Consider the safety implications of your definition. Be sure your definition of a fuzzy or ambiguous term such as safe levels of exposure, conservative investment, or acceptable risk is based on fair and accurate interpretation of the facts and makes clear to readers the safety implications for them and their families. Place your definition in an appropriate location. Allow readers to access the definition and then return to the main text with as little disruption as possible. You might use a glossary, or, for an online document, you might consider hyperlinks that define the terms or ideas but keep readers on the same document page. Cite your sources, as needed.

["email.html", "Chapter 8 Email 8.1 Workplace Email 8.2 Types of Workplace Emails 8.3 Appropriate Style for Workplace Email 8.4 Copyright and Privacy in Digital Communication", " Chapter 8 Email Workplace communication typically involves a combination of both print and digital media. Reading Considerations “Unlike paper documents, with email you have little control over the final audience” (352). How so? What are the implications of this and how you do account for them? Note standard email organization (353). Practicing convention is important to maintain credibility and professionalism. Poorly organized emails will quickly undermine your credibility and might mean your message will not be read (or taken seriously). “. . . do not forward a particularly sensitive email without permission, edit a forwarded email, or send enormous attachments” (353). Why? Think about examples of repercussions for doing any of the above. In general, how do the rules of netiquette described in this chapter apply to different places you have worked? To different discourse communities to which you belong? Focus on best practices and strategies for professional email, especially guidelines on how to write a subject line (which are similiar to MEMO subject lines and document titles). 8.1 Workplace Email Email is the primary way people communicate in today’s workplace and professional settings; it has all but replaced the paper memo and letter. Email offers both rapid speed and wide reach: With one keystroke, an email can quickly reach the inboxes of thousands of people. Email can be used to communicate the main message or to provide a cover note, directing readers to a longer message in an attachment (typically Word or PDF). In either case, email is best suited for straightforward messages that are not too long and that do not leave a lot of room for misunderstanding. 8.1.1 Audience and Purpose of Email You do not have total control over the final audience. Remember this cardinal rule about email: Always assume your message will travel far beyond its intended recipient, and never send anything private or confidential via email. Email accomplishes various purposes: to schedule meetings, update team members on a project, send simple memos in electronic form, and send attached documents to colleagues both within and outside of an organization. Email can be used to communicate the main message or to provide a cover note, directing readers to a longer message in an attachment (typically Word or PDF). Think carefully about whether email is the best medium for the given message. If you want your message to be private or confidential or if your message is too complex for email, set up a personal meeting or phone call. 8.1.2 Components and Organization of Email A typical email message combines features from both memos and letters. Emails usually begin with a heading, containing “To,” “From,” “Date,” and “Subject” fields. Most email programs also feature the courtesy copy (“cc”) and blind courtesy copy (“bec”) fields. Use “cc” for people who need to know but are not central to the conversation. Use “bcc” for a very long list of recipients or for individuals who need to be in the loop but may not want their email address visible. Attachments (such as PDF files or other documents too large or too formal for the email itself) take the place of the “enclosure” notation on a paper memo or letter. Depending on the level of formality, email may sometimes be written with openings and closings (“Dear John,” “Best, Linda”). Regardless of length, an effective email should contain a brief introduction (even a single sentence) that gets right to the point, a clear body section with transitions (again, this section may be only a few sentences), and a brief conclusion that might ask readers to take action (such as “Please get back to me by 5:00 p.m. on Monday”). Visually, longer emails are easier for readers to process if information is broken into chunks, such as short paragraphs and bulleted lists. However, because email can be viewed on a range of screen sizes (computer, tablet, phone), keep email messages to about the size of one screen or less. 8.2 Types of Workplace Emails Email takes different shapes and forms, depending on where you work. A typical workplace email is show as: Do not use email to solve a complex situation, particularly an interpersonal one. Email is often used as a kind of cover memo to a longer attachment. The email itself contains three short paragraphs (introduction; body; conclusion), which serve to provide background, some details, and context for the consultant. A Cover Email Message Another way email is used, particularly in large organizations, is as a formatted document that resembles company letterhead or other official communication. Unlike the examples discussed above, which are between two individuals, this type of email is sent from one part of the organization to all employees or to a large group of employees.The appearance signifies that the message is official and important. Figure 18.3 illustrates one such email; there is no attachment, rather, the email itself is formatted to look like a memo on letterhead. But because the message is digital, it contains links that readers can click on for more information. Typically, organizations will use the same visual format as a way to let readers know they should read the message. Formatting is clear, with plenty of white space, short paragraphs, and bulleted lists. A Formatted Email Message Strategies for Choosing and Using Email Consider whether your message is for one person or for a large group. Email between individuals is usually written within the email itself, but information for large groups (such as all employees, people who have signed up for a fitness plan, and so on) should be formatted in a way to make the message appear official. Doing so helps ensure that people will read the message. Determine if the situation is too complicated for email. Solving complicated interpersonal issues (Such as disagreements between team members) is not what email was designed to do. Use email in these cases to tone down the discussion and invite people to a meeting, conference call, or video chat, where employees can engage in real conversations and listen to each other. Send attachments for long items or formal documents. It’s tempting to just paste the entire contents of a long document directly into an email message, but readers won’t appreciate this approach. Use attachments (in Word, if you are still working on the document or don’t care about precise page formatting, or in PDF if the document is complete and formatting needs to be retained). But don’t send too many attachments—it can be confusing for people to receive more than three attachments with any single email. For more than three documents, upload to a shared file server or the company intranet instead. Consider confidentiality. Email may not be the best medium for sending legal documents, confidential company files, or anything else that should remain private. Also, before forwarding a message, obtain permission from the sender, who may have intended the message for you only. Assume your email is permanent and readable by anyone at any time. Forensic software can find virtually any file that has been deleted, so don’t make promises you cannot keep or expect anything else you say to disappear forever. Use appropriate formatting. Provide a brief introduction, details in the body, and a conclusion. Use bullets, headings, numbered lists, italics, and other formatting features to make your message easy to read. Keep it short. Readers are impatient and don’t want to scroll through long screens of information. Messages longer than one screen will often go unread. If you must send a complex message, put longer details in an attachment. End with a signature block. If appropriate, include the name and address of your organization or department, your telephone and fax number, and other contact information by using an automatic signature block. 8.3 Appropriate Style for Workplace Email Email between friends and family (personal email) often contains deliberately misspelled or abbreviated words, a disregard for grammatical rules, a lax attitude toward proper punctuation, a highly informal tone, and an emphasis on brevity over completeness. Workplace email, however, should use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Avoid using capital letters, and be careful with abbreviations (“LOL,” “imho,” and the like) and emojis. As noted in the previous examples, always use a professional, respectful tone. A workplace email that is too casual (e.g., using such words as “uh huh,” “whatever,” and “cool”) or is incomplete will undermine the writer’s professionalism and confuse readers. Be sure to avoid flaming (angry, sarcastic, insulting messages that will only lead to repercussions). Don’t use biased language that demeans or excludes some potential readers. Do not use email for interpersonal issues, and avoid using it to blame others. Also, do not forward a particularly sensitive email without permission from the original writer, and do not edit an email to change the original meaning. The word “netiquette” reflects the idea of Internet etiquette, the concept that online writers need to be especially careful and considerate of style, tone, feelings, and authority. Figure 18.4 shows an email lacking in professional style and overall online etiquette. Although the writer and recipient are close personal friends Workplace Email Lacking Style and Tone in addition to their employee-supervisor relationship, an email like this should never be written in the workplace. Not only does the message have legal implications in terms of the writer’s job performance and future employment, but it also violates another employee’s confidentiality. It is also much too informal for any workplace document. Remember that email does not disappear. Your message will be backed up and saved somewhere (usually on the organization’s backup system or the like) and may be brought up later in personnel or legal proceedings. Frank (the writer in Figure 18.4) did not stop to consider that his email is not just a one-time message, never to be seen again. His email could be used as part of an employment or disciplinary case later. Email may not seem permanent, but it is. Pressing “send” too quickly can be a problem down the road. Think before you type, and think again (and proofread, and wait a bit) before you send. Strategies for Email Style and Tone in the Workplace Consider your audience. If you are writing to a customer, client, or superior in your organization, use a more formal tone than with a coworker or immediate supervisor. If you know your recipient well, use an informal salutation (“Hello”) and an informal closing (“Regards,” “Best”). However, for someone you don’t know or someone in authority, use a formal salutation (“Dear Dr. Gomez”) and a formal closing (“Sincerely”). Consider your purpose. Don’t use email when a more personal medium is preferable. Sometimes an issue is best resolved by talking face to face, making a phone call, or even just leaving a voice mail. Don’t use email to resign from a job, request a raise, respond to a formal letter, or respond to something that may have legal implications. Write a clear subject line. Instead of “Test Data” or “Data Request,” be specific: “Request for Beta Test Data for Project 18.” This line helps recipients decide whether to read the message immediately, and it helps for filing and future reference. Use informal language, emojis, and abbreviations sparingly —if at all. Even in an informal message, use proper spelling, grammar, and mechanics (avoid using only lowercase letters or all capital letters). Emojis should be avoided in workplace emails. The same goes for common abbreviations (FYI, ASAP, OMG), although technical abbreviations that are widely understood in your workplace are fine. Proofread thoroughly before hitting “send.” Every message reflects your image, so double-check any email with your name on it. Also, be careful that the email goes only to your intended recipients. Be professional. Take time to read email carefully; respond in a timely manner; avoid flaming (angry or personal attacks) and biased language; do not edit forwarded emails without the sender’s permission Remember that there is a person on the other end of the message. Email (and other forms of digital media) provide a shield, of sorts, between you and your reader(s). In a rush to finish up some work, or in a moment of feeling frustrated or even angry, you may write a message that makes you feel good but forgets the very real fact that a person, not a machine, will read your words. Try writing out your thoughts in a separate document, or write the email but save it in the “drafts” folder. Review it again in a few hours and revise, keeping your “reader as person” in mind. 8.4 Copyright and Privacy in Digital Communication Copyright is a system of legal protection for original works of authorship (books,photographs, user manuals, music) that are “fixed in a tangible medium.” In other words, copyright applies when an idea becomes recorded or written down or otherwise fixed, as in a printed book, an email message, a Web site, or a recorded piece of music. In technical writing and communication, especially with digital communication,there are a few key aspects of copyright to be aware of. In the workplace, if you are a full-time employee, most of what you write and create is typically owned by the company. So be careful about posting material to a blog or Web site without first obtaining permission from the company. Also, you may find a photograph or piece of music or image on a Web site and think it’s the perfect visual for the report you are writing. But unless your use is for educational purposes or the piece is clearly marked as “copyright free” or “in the public domain,” you probably need to seek permission to use the item. If you are unsure about the copyright status of a work, it’s best to consult with a librarian or with the author of the material, keeping in mind that sometimes the author is a corporate, not individual, author. Digital communication also raises privacy issues. For example, avoid forwarding an email without checking with the sender first. Likewise, don’t forward proprietary information (information that originates in your company) to unauthorized recipients outside the company. "]
